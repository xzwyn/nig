Biobert models, finetuned models of these below,

https://huggingface.co/emilyalsentzer/Bio_ClinicalBERT 
from biobert and trained on all MIMIC notes (MIMIC database contains extensive information on patient medications and diagnoses)

https://huggingface.co/emilyalsentzer/Bio_Discharge_Summary_BERT
similar but trained on only discharge summaries from MIMIC notes, summary includes hospital course, but i think bioClinical is better than this

finetuned qwen model, seems like it can help

https://huggingface.co/epfl-llm/meditron-7b
https://github.com/epfLLM/meditron
llama2-7b finetuned on medical corpus, including PubMed abstracts and other med documents

https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/biogpt
GPT 2 on biod=medical tasks and docs

https://huggingface.co/BioMistral/BioMistral-7B
Mistral trained on PubMed data

https://huggingface.co/clinicalnlplab/me-llama
llama2 but on clinical notes and biomedical data


other models which are computationally a bit expensive also dont know much on their capabilities on medicinal data, but are medical llms

It also determines how we interact in all our business areas with our customers, partners, employees, investors, as well as with governments, regulatory authorities, civil society, people with disabilities, and future generations.</p>\n",

Our sustainability statement describes the key sustainability aspects for Allianz and how we address them. We follow the structure of the European Standards for Sustainability Reporting (European Sustainability Reporting Standards, ESRS), which focus on the most important sustainability aspects (environment, social, and governance) and provide a stable framework for disclosure to ensure comparability and credibility. In accordance with these standards, we have organized our sustainability statement into key sections, as explained in the following paragraphs.</p>\n",

              "<p>In the Materiality section, we report on the results of our double materiality assessment under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which defines the relevance of potential sustainability aspects for our business. This section therefore describes the ESRS topics that are material for Allianz.</p>\n",
              "<h2>How do we ensure that measures are taken? - Guidelines</h2>\n",
              "<p>At Allianz, our corporate rules set the framework for business decision-making, which is also subject to control measures. The section on integrating sustainability through corporate rules and other ESRS guidelines describes how we incorporate sustainability aspects into decision-making. Detailed corporate rules and other guidelines in the sense of the ESRS for specific ESRS topics are explained in the respective thematic sections of the report and in the section on Allianz ESRS guidelines. Information regarding guidelines in the sense of the ESRS is highlighted in bold and dark blue.</p>\n",
              "<h2>What is our concrete level of ambition? - Goals</h2>\n",
              "<p>If appropriate, we set concrete goals for relevant sustainability aspects. These goals serve as a benchmark for us and determine our level of ambition in the respective area. In line with the structure of the ESRS, we address goals in two sections:</p>\n",
              "<p>in the section on the board’s goal‑setting process for sustainability objectives that are relevant to the board remuneration, and</p>\n",
              "<p>55 fundamentals for the creation</p>\n",
              "<p>- in the thematic sections of this report on additional “goals” with reference to relevant sustainability aspects.</p>\n",
              "<p>As trustees, our asset managers are responsible for prudently managing the assets of each client in accordance with their established portfolio objectives and guidelines. For this reason, our asset managers manage other clients' assets solely with consideration of these objectives and guidelines and do not apply Allianz's objectives when managing other clients' assets.</p>\n",
              "<h2>How do we reach our ambition level? - Measures</h2>\n",
              "<p>The assessment of our progress toward goal attainment contributes to clear sustainability reporting. According to the ESRS, it must be specified which measures have been taken and how these measures have contributed to the relevant sustainability aspects during the reporting period. When reliable data points are available, we quantify our measures and indicate to what extent they support our ambitions and concrete goals.</p>\n",

              "<p>In the sustainability statement, we address our sustainability strategy and governance in addition to guidelines, goals, and measures. These elements are central to understanding the context and the diligence we apply at Allianz for integrating sustainability.</p>\n",

We are aware of the need for reliable data and processes to ensure stable integration into our business and to ensure that our external reporting is reliable. For this reason, we have commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, to conduct an audit with reasonable assurance.</p>\n",
              "<h2>Summaries in the thematic sections of our sustainability statement</h2>\n",
              "<p>To make it easier for readers to understand the Allianz’s sustainability topics, we have inserted blue‑bordered summaries in each section. These summaries are a recommended starting point for anyone interested in the Allianz’s sustainability aspects and wants to know how we address them.

To ensure clarity and comparability, we generally align the terminology we use with the CSRD and the ESRS. In the German version of our sustainability statement, we may deviate from the official translation. We use the terms “ESG” (Environmental – Umwelt, Social – Soziales, Governance – Unternehmensführung) and “sustainability” interchangeably depending on context.

In the ESRS, a company's own business activities are not explicitly defined. However, they contain a definition for the value chain. Therefore, discretion is required to distinguish the company's own business activities from the downstream value chain, particularly in the area of own investments in our case. Allianz's concept treats the reporting of our own investments as part of our downstream value chain, including the capital investments over which we exercise financial control. Notwithstanding this, we have not excluded anything in our double materiality assessment due to this distinction. For reporting purposes, an assignment of significant impacts, risks and opportunities is made based on the aforementioned concept. Sustainability aspects related to the investment of third‑party funds concern products that are available to a wide range of investors and are governed by a publicly accessible prospectus from AllianzGI or PIMCO and registered with a supervisory authority.

Übergangsrisiken und physische Risiken können als Übertragungskanäle zu anderen traditionellen versicherungsbezogenen Risiken wie Underwriting- und Bepreisungsrisiken dienen. Diese Risiken werden je nach Geschäftszweig durch das Underwriting, die Preisgestaltung, Schadenbearbeitung und die Produktentwicklung gesteuert. So berechnet beispielsweise ein Underwriting-Tool das Akkumulations- risiko in unseren Schadenversicherungsportfolios. Die Diversifizierung der Versicherungsprodukte trägt ebenfalls dazu bei, diese Risiken zu mindern. Traditionelle Instrumente des Versicherungsrisikomanagements, wie die Festlegung von Limits, Rückversicherungen und Selbstbehaltpolicen, steuern ebenfalls Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken in unseren Portfolios. Die Steuerung von Nachhaltigkeitsrisiken ist in die Maßnahmen zur Steuerung anderer relevanter Risiken innerhalb unserer Versicherungsportfolios integriert:</p>\n",

              "<p>Schadenbearbeitung: Die Bearbeitung von Schadensfällen ist ein wichtiger Prozess, um Schadensereignisse, die auf physische umweltbedingte Risiken zurückzuführen sind, effektiv zu managen. Die Ressorts Claims, Aktuariat und Underwriting schätzen den erwarteten Umfang eines Umweltvorfalls und seine Auswirkungen auf die Ressourcen ab. Dabei werden Tools wie GIS verwendet, um Regionen mit hoher Exponierung zu ermitteln, die Bereitschaft sicherzustellen und dann die Anzahl der gemeldeten Schadensfälle in der ersten Zeit nach einem Vorfall zu erfassen. Wenn die Schäden einen festgelegten Schwellenwert überschreiten, richtet die betroffene Tochtergesellschaft eine Taskforce mit vorab festgelegten Verantwortlichkeiten und Prozessen ein, einschließlich der Möglichkeit, Partnernetzwerke einzusetzen und Arbeit auszulagern.

Für Portfoliounternehmen, die AIS-Auslöseschwellen treffen, finden weitere Bewertungen statt, oft in enger Zusammenarbeit mit unseren Vermögensverwaltern, und sie werden regelmäßig in Sitzungen zur Nachhaltigkeitsprüfung der Vermögensverwalter besprochen. Wir entscheiden über die nächsten Schritte, die ein Engagement mit Verbesserungszielsetzungen oder die Einschränkung des Emittenten umfassen können.

              "<h2>Nachhaltige Finanzanlagen</h2>\n",
              "<p>Die Allianz stuft Finanzanlagen als nachhaltig ein, wenn sie der EU- Taxonomie oder gemäß unserer Definition den Anforderungen von Artikel 2 Absatz 17 der Offenlegungsverordnung (Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, SFDR) entsprechen und die folgenden Kriterien erfüllen: 1. Positiver Beitrag zu einer ökologischen und/oder sozialen Zielsetzung; 2. Einhaltung des Grundsatzes „Vermeidung erheblicher Beeinträchtigungen“ und 3. Anwendung der Verfahrensweisen einer guten Unternehmensführung.</p>\n",
              "<p>Unser Ansatz zu nachhaltigen Finanzanlagen deckt eine Vielzahl von Nachhaltigkeitsthemen (Umwelt, Soziales und Governance) und alle wichtigen Vermögensklassen ab, in die wir investiert sind. Eine detaillierte Beschreibung unserer nachhaltigen Anlagemethodik finden Sie in den Erläuterungen auf der Allianz Website.</p>\n",
              "<h2>Beschränkungen</h2>\n",
              "<p>In Übereinstimmung mit unseren Richtlinien für Kraftwerkskohle, Ölsand sowie Öl und Gas – und da wir die Zukunft dieser Geschäfts- modelle als gefährdet einstufen – schränken wir Investitionen in bestimmte Unternehmen oder Projekte im Bereich fossiler Brennstoffe ein (Desinvestition bei Eigenkapital und Run-off bei Fremdkapital- anlagen). Für weitere Einzelheiten siehe E1 Klimawandel.</p>\n",
              "<p>Die Allianz verbietet Finanzanlagen in umstrittene Waffen, wie sie im ASIS definiert sind. Seit 2023 haben wir weitere Beschränkungen für Unternehmen eingeführt, die sich nicht an den Atomwaffen- sperrvertrag der Vereinten Nationen halten.</p>\n",
              "<p>Wir beschränken auch Finanzanlagen in Staatsanleihen von Ländern, die mit schwerwiegenden Menschenrechtsverletzungen und erheblichen Problemen bei deren Behebung in Verbindung gebracht werden. Zur Bewertung von Staatsemittenten nutzen wir Nachhaltigkeitsratings externer Datenanbieter und überprüfen die Menschenrechtssituation anhand des Allianz Human Rights Risk Score, der auf der Allgemeinen Erklärung der Menschenrechte der Vereinten Nationen basiert. Unsere internen Expertinnen und Experten bewerten das Menschenrechtsrisiko von Ländern anhand von Informationen von NGOs und internen Recherchen.</p>\n",

              "<p>Für Immobilien, die sich vollständig im Besitz der Allianz befinden, und zukünftig für alle wesentlichen Vermögenswerte an einem Standort muss ein firmeneigenes Allianz Tool verwendet werden, um das physische Risiko des Klimawandels zu bewerten.

              "<p>Das Asset Management Segment des Allianz Konzerns erachtet, wo dies angemessen ist, die Integration von Nachhaltigkeitsfaktoren als wichtigen Treiber der Branche. Als aktive Manager mit erwiesenen Analyse-Kapazitäten arbeiten unsere beiden großen Vermögensverwalter, AllianzGI und PIMCO, mit ihren sich für Nachhaltigkeitsaspekte interessierenden Kundinnen und Kunden zusammen an Anlagestrategien und -aspekten, um sie bei der Erreichung ihrer Nachhaltigkeitsziele zu unterstützen.</p>\n",
              "<p>Investieren unter Berücksichtigung von Nachhaltigkeitsaspekten ist ein zentraler Teil der Strategie von AllianzGI. AllianzGI hat ihr Angebot an nachhaltigen und wirkungsorientierten Anlageprodukten und maßgeschneiderten Lösungen in öffentlichen und privaten Märkten weiter ausgebaut. Es wurden drei Leitmotive identifiziert – Klimawandel, Belastbarkeitsgrenzen des Planeten und inklusiver Kapitalismus – die wesentlich für die Gesellschaft, Investoren und AllianzGI sind. Diese Leitmotive fließen in die Analysetätigkeit, die Stewardship-Aktivitäten, die Produktentwicklung und das Engagement in der Branche ein. Die ESG-Strategien von AllianzGI werden wie folgt klassifiziert:</p>\n",
              "<p>− ESG-Risikofokussierte Portfolios: Einbeziehung wesentlicher ESG- Risikoerwägungen in den Investitionsprozess über alle Assetklassen hinweg, um höhere risikobereinigte Renditen zu erzielen, ohne das Anlageuniversum einzuschränken.</p>\n",

              "<p>− Nachhaltigkeitsorientiertes Produktangebot: Dies zielt darauf ab, finanzielle Erträge für die Kundinnen und Kunden zu erzielen und dabei Nachhaltigkeitszielsetzungen und -werte zu verfolgen. Zu diesem Zweck wendet AllianzGI eine Reihe nachhaltiger Mindestausschlüsse und nachhaltiger Ansätze für Kapitalanlagen an, darunter SRI (Sustainable and Responsible Investing) oder einen KPI-basierten Ansatz, der beispielsweise auf einen Weg zur Treibhausgasreduktion abzielt.</p>\n",
              "<p>− Wirkungsorientierte Ansätze: Unterstützung von Investoren, die positive Änderungen für den Planeten und die Gesellschaft anstreben, gemessen an Zielen wie den SDGs der Vereinten Nationen bei gleichzeitiger Erzielung einer finanziellen Rendite.</p>\n",

              "<p>PIMCO definiert Strategien für verwaltetes Vermögen in nachhaltigen Anlagen als Strategien, die Folgendes umfassen:</p>\n",
              "<p>− Mindeststandards, die die Anlagemöglichkeiten auf der Grundlage von kundenseitig festgelegten Ausschlusskriterien verfeinern („ausschließende“ Portfolios),</p>\n",
              "<p>− Verbesserung der nachhaltigen Merkmale des Portfolios im Vergleich zu dessen Anlageuniversum („erweiterte“ Portfolios) oder</p>\n",
              "<p>− Erreichen einer bestimmten ökologischen/sozialen Zielsetzung in Ergänzung zu einer finanziellen Zielsetzung („thematische“ Portfolios).</p>\n",
              "<p>Für Kundinnen und Kunden, die eine stärkere Nachhaltigkeitsorientierung in ihrem Portfolio anstreben, verwaltet PIMCO eine Reihe von Mandaten, die Nachhaltigkeitsstrategien und - richtlinien folgen. Diese Strategien nutzen die drei Bausteine des Prozesses der ESG-Portfoliozusammenstellung von PIMCO: Begrenzung der Exponierung gegenüber Sektoren und Emittenten mit höheren ESG-Risikofaktoren, Hervorhebung von Emittenten mit führenden und sich optimierenden ESG-Risikominderungsstrategien und solchen, die versuchen, ESG-Aktivitäten und -Geschäftsmodelle zu nutzen, sowie konstruktive Zusammenarbeit mit Emittenten, um dabei zu unterstützen, ESG- und Nachhaltigkeitspraktiken im Laufe der Zeit zu beeinflussen.</p>\n",
              "<p>73 Integration von Nachhaltigkeit</p>\n",
              "<p>PIMCO ist der Ansicht, dass die Berücksichtigung relevanter ESG- Faktoren Bestandteil des Anlagenanalyseprozesses ist. ESG-Faktoren können wichtige Aspekte bei der Bewertung langfristiger Chancen und Risiken für Kapitalanlagen in verschiedenen Vermögensklassen in öffentlichen und privaten Märkten liefern.</p>\n",
              "<p>PIMCO ist sich bewusst, dass ESG-Faktoren bei der Bewertung von globalen Volkswirtschaften, Märkten, Branchen und Geschäftsmodellen an Bedeutung zunehmen. Die Relevanz von ESG- Aspekten bei Investitionsentscheidungen variiert je nach Anlageklasse, Strategie, Produkt, Bewertung und Anlagehorizont. Die Integration relevanter Faktoren bedeutet nicht, dass ESG-bezogene Informationen die ausschließlich relevanten Aspekte sind. Die Portfoliomanager und Analysten von PIMCO berücksichtigen bei ihren Anlageentscheidungen verschiedene Faktoren und deren Wesentlichkeit. Durch die Erweiterung und Diversifizierung der dem Portfolio-Management-Team zur Verfügung stehenden Informationen kann PIMCO eine ganzheitlichere Sicht auf eine Kapitalanlage bieten, von der sie überzeugt sind, dass die Kundinnen und Kunden davon profitieren werden. Weitere Einzelheiten sind im Sustainable Investing Report von PIMCO zu finden.</p>\n",

Zuliefernde Unternehmen, die einen bestimmten Schwellenwert überschreiten, müssen zusätzliche Fragen zum Thema Nachhaltigkeit beantworten.

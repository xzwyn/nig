1,UncategorizedText,"Sustainability Statement, which also fulfils the requirements for the Group non-financial statement prepared in accordance with sections § 315b to § 315c HGB"
1,Title,BASIS FOR PREPARATION
1,NarrativeText,Allianz Group approach to sustainability reporting
1,NarrativeText,"Allianz’s purpose – We secure your future – guides our actions across the Allianz Group and drives us to pursue constant innovation and collaboration. It also guides our interactions with our customers, partners, employees, investors, governments, regulators, society, people with disabilities, and next generations across all our businesses."
1,Title,How do we make sure action is taken? — Policies
1,NarrativeText,"At Allianz, business decision-making is governed by our corporate rules and is subject to oversight. The section Integrating sustainability via corporate rules and other ESRS policies outlines how we integrate sustainability matters into decision-making. Detailed corporate rules and other policies in the meaning of ESRS on specific ESRS topics are explained in the respective topical sections of the report and the section Allianz ESRS policies. Information on policies in the meaning of ESRS is highlighted in bold and dark blue."
1,NarrativeText,"Our ambition is to actively support the transition toward a more sustainable economy in collaboration with our value chain, focusing on measurable actions, transparent reporting, and long-term positive impacts across societies, economies, and the environment."
1,NarrativeText,"A core pillar of our sustainability ambition is to follow clear, transparent practices and provide high-quality, verifiable reporting that reflects our ongoing commitment to measurable sustainability outcomes. Our Sustainability Statement outlines the sustainability matters material for Allianz and how we address them. We adhere to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) structure, which focuses on key sustainability aspects (environment, social, and governance) and provides a robust disclosure framework for comparability and credibility. In alignment with these standards, we have structured our Sustainability Statement in key sections, as detailed in the following paragraphs."
1,Title,Which sustainability matters are relevant for Allianz? - Materiality
1,Title,What is our concrete ambition level? - Targets
1,NarrativeText,"Where applicable, we set concrete targets related to relevant sustainability matters. These targets are our yardsticks defining our ambition level in the respective area. Following the ESRS structure, we include two sections on targets:"
1,NarrativeText,"− the sustainability targets relevant to board remuneration in the section Board of Management target process, and − additional “targets” related to relevant sustainability matters in the topical sections of the report."
1,NarrativeText,"As fiduciaries, our asset managers have a responsibility to manage each client’s assets prudently in accordance with their specified portfolio objectives and guidelines. For this reason, our Asset Managers manage third-party client assets solely in consideration of these objectives and guidelines, and do not apply Allianz’s targets when managing these third-party client assets."
1,NarrativeText,"In the section Materiality, we present the results of our Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) double materiality assessment, which defines the relevance of potential sustainability matters for our business. This section therefore outlines the ESRS topics material to Allianz."

1,Title,How do we reach our ambition level? - Actions
1,NarrativeText,"Clarity in sustainability reporting is facilitated by the assessment of our progress in achieving our targets. The ESRS requires reporting on “actions” taken and how these actions address the relevant sustainability matters during the reporting period. Where reliable data points are available, we quantify our actions and assess to which degree these actions support our ambitions and concrete targets."
1,Title,Further key elements of our Sustainability Statement and our quality aspirations
1,NarrativeText,"Alongside our “policies”, “targets”, and “actions”, the Sustainability Statement explains our sustainability strategy and governance. These parts are key for understanding the context and diligence we apply in integrating sustainability at Allianz."
1,NarrativeText,"At Allianz, we are committed to high standards of quality in our sustainability reporting. We recognize the need for reliable data and processes for robust business integration and to ensure our external disclosures are reliable. For that reason, we mandated PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich, to perform a “reasonable assurance engagement”."
1,Title,Summary boxes in topical sections of our Sustainability Statement
1,NarrativeText,"To help readers understand Allianz's sustainability topics, we have added blue summary boxes in each section. These boxes are a recommended starting point for anyone interested in Allianz's sustainability matters and how we address them. They are written in simple language and can be read separately from the more technical and regulated content."

2,Title,Terminology used in our Sustainability Statement
2,NarrativeText,"Sustainability is an evolving topic with various terminologies provided by standard setters and market practices. To ensure understandability and comparability, we align our terminology generally with the CSRD and ESRS. In the German version of our Sustainability Statement, we may modify standard translations. We use “ESG” (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and “sustainability” interchangeably, depending on the context. Every time we mention “Allianz” in our Sustainability Statement, we refer to the Allianz Group as a whole, unless stated otherwise."

2,Title,Basis for preparation of the Sustainability Statement
2,NarrativeText,"Given the still due national transposition of the CSRD into German national law, the Allianz Sustainability Statement is compiled per the Non-financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) (Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU), which has been transposed into German law via § 315b to § 315c HGB, and ESRS (Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 of 31 July 2023 supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council). The ESRS are considered a recognized European Union-based"

2,NarrativeText,framework under the NFRD. All references to CSRD in the Sustainability Statement also address the underlying ESRS.
2,NarrativeText,"This Sustainability Statement covers the Allianz Group and has been prepared on a consolidated basis, with the identical consolidation scope as for our financial reporting as per the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Due to the inclusion in the consolidated Sustainability Statement of Allianz Group, subsidiary undertakings make use of the exemption to expand their management report to include a Sustainability Statement in accordance with Articles 19 (a) para. 9 or Article 29 (a) para. 8 of CSRD as transposed into national law as the case may be. We list the exempted subsidiaries in note 8.20 to the consolidated financial statements."
2,NarrativeText,"The Sustainability Statement covers material sustainability matters across our value chain, including"
2,ListItem,"− Insurance – Life/Health (re)insurance (Life/Health), Property and Casualty (re)insurance (Property-Casualty), − Proprietary investments,"
2,ListItem,"− Asset management – third-party investments business, and"
2,ListItem,− Allianz own operations (and Supply chain).
2,NarrativeText,"This includes our CSRD double materiality assessment, policies, actions, and targets, as well as metrics in line with ESRS requirements. The ESRS do not define an undertaking’s own operations. However, they provide a definition for value chain. As such, judgement needs to be applied to distinguish between own operations and downstream value chain, in our case especially where proprietary investments are concerned. Allianz’s policy considers the reporting of all our proprietary investments as part of our downstream value chain, including investments where we have financial control. Notwithstanding, in our double materiality assessment we have not excluded anything due to this distinction. For the purpose of disclosures, we allocate our material impacts, risks, and opportunities based on the abovementioned policy. Sustainability matters for the third-party assets under management concern products that are available to a multitude of investors, governed by a publicly accessible AllianzGI or PIMCO prospectus and registered with a regulator. Further interpretations have been presented in the respective chapters for better readability."
2,NarrativeText,"All measures, activities, and key figures refer to the 2024 financial year (1 January to 31 December 2024). Allianz has not used the option to omit a specific piece of information corresponding to intellectual property, know-how, or the results of innovation. For the disclosure of the gender pay gap ratio in line with S1-16, we have applied the safeguard clause according to ESRS 2.5 (e) in conjunction with §§ 289e and 315c HGB."
2,NarrativeText,"This Sustainability Statement, which is integrated into the Management Report, is subject to a reasonable assurance engagement by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Munich. Unless otherwise stated, the measurement of the metrics presented in the Sustainability Statement have not been validated by an external body other than our auditor. References to information published outside the Annual Report, Allianz Group’s Management Report, and the Remuneration Report are supplementary and do not form an integral part of this Sustainability Statement."
2,Title,Use of estimates for our value chain
2,NarrativeText,"Allianz’s sustainability-related impacts, risks, and opportunities primarily arise from our upstream and downstream value chain, rather than our own operations, due to the nature of our business model. Therefore, our ability to drive positive change, mitigate risks, and capitalize on opportunities depends on how effectively we manage and influence sustainability practices beyond our own operations. To measure our sustainability performance, we also rely on estimates for our value chain, as obtaining the necessary information can vary depending on factors such as contractual arrangements and our level of control. As such, we supplement direct sources of information with indirect sources, such as sector-average data or other proxies. When using such estimations, we ensure they are based on sound methodologies appropriate for the context."
2,NarrativeText,"We apply the criteria of accuracy, relevance, and consistency to all estimates to ensure results are reliable and useful. Details regarding the metrics for which estimates are used, including their basis for preparation, scope, level of accuracy, assumptions, and potential sources of measurement uncertainties, are reported alongside the metrics in our Sustainability Statement."
